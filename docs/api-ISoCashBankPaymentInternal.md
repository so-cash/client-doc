## ðŸ“œ ISoCashBankPaymentInternal interface 

Interface for exposing events related to interbank payments 

### Events

#### ðŸ“¢ __Adviced__
Event emitted by a bank that receives a notification of debit/credit on an account it owns in another bank 

```js
event Adviced(address indexed target, address indexed account, uint256 amount, uint8 direction, uint256 indexed id)
```
This notification is done via the `advice()` method in the [ISoCashInterBank](./api-ISoCashInterBank) interface
