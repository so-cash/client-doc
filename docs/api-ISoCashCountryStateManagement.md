## üìú ISoCashCountryStateManagement

The interface for banks to records elements in a country referential

The interface is used to set the bank module, the correspondent bank, the SSI and the FX provider by a controller of a bank. 

Functions are typically controlling that the caller is the controller for the `bankCode`

### Methods

#### ‚öôÔ∏è __addCorrespondent__
