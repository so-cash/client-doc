### Methods

#### ‚öôÔ∏è __accountNumberOf__
get the account number for an account smart contract

```js
function accountNumberOf(address account) view returns (uint32)
```
| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | account | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account to get the account number of |


| Pos | Return | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | ‚åÄ | [AccountNumber](./api-t-AccountNumber.md) | uint32 | The account number of the account or zero if not found |


#### ‚öôÔ∏è __addressOf__
get the account address for an account number

```js
function addressOf(uint32 accountNumber) view returns (address)
```
| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | accountNumber | [AccountNumber](./api-t-AccountNumber.md) | uint32 | The account number to get the account address of |


| Pos | Return | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | ‚åÄ | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account address of the account number or zero if not found |


#### ‚öôÔ∏è __addressOfFullAccount__
get the account address for an account string as present in an IBAN

```js
function addressOfFullAccount(string account) view returns (address)
```
| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | account | string | string | The account part of the IBAN to get the account address of |


| Pos | Return | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | ‚åÄ | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account address of the account of zero if not found |


#### ‚öôÔ∏è __fullBalanceOf__
Get the full balance of an account

```js
function fullBalanceOf(address account) view returns (int256)
```
The full balance is the actual liability of the bank towards the account holder. It can be negative it the account is in overdraft. 

Note that the `balanceOf()` method of the ERC20 standard is also available in the bank module via the interface [IERC20Compatibility](./api-IERC20Compatibility).

| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | account | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account to get the full balance of |


| Pos | Return | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | ‚åÄ | int256 | int256 | The full balance of the account |


#### ‚öôÔ∏è __lockedBalanceOf__
Get the locked balance of an account

```js
function lockedBalanceOf(address account) view returns (uint256)
```
The locked balance is the amount that has been earmarked for specific transactions by the account owner (or the bank)

| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | account | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account to get the locked balance of |


| Pos | Return | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | ‚åÄ | uint256 | uint256 | The locked balance of the account |


#### ‚öôÔ∏è __unlockedBalanceOf__
Get the unlocked balance of an account

```js
function unlockedBalanceOf(address account) view returns (uint256)
```
The unlocked balance is the amount that is immediatly available for the account owner to spend

| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | account | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account to get the unlocked balance of |
