## üìú ISoCashBankBackOfficeServices interface

Interface for the back office to accounts, nostros and local credit and debits.

This interface exposes methods for whitelisted back office wallets. 

### Events

#### üì¢ __BankCreation__
Event emitted when the module is created

```js
event BankCreation(address indexed bank, string bic, string currency)
```
Deprecated: Prefer the event `BankModuleSet` emitted at registration in the referential in [ISoCashCountryStateManagement](./api-ISoCashCountryStateManagement)

| Pos | Args | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | bank | [ISoCashBank](./api-t-ISoCashBank.md) | address | The bank module that is created |
|2 | bic | string | string | The BIC of the bank |
|3 | currency | string | string | The currency of the bank |


#### üì¢ __BankRegistration__
Event emitted when the bank module is Registered

```js
event BankRegistration(address indexed bank, bool registered)
```
Deprecated (and not emitted in Diamond implementation). Use `BankModuleSet` emitted at registration in the referential in [ISoCashCountryStateManagement](./api-ISoCashCountryStateManagement)

| Pos | Args | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | bank | [ISoCashBank](./api-t-ISoCashBank.md) | address | The bank module that is registered |
|2 | registered | bool | bool | True if the bank is registered, false if it is unregistered |


### Methods

#### ‚öôÔ∏è __correspondent__
Get the correspondent bank identifier of a correspondent bank module

```js
function correspondent(address correspondent) view returns (tuple(bytes2 country, bytes10[] codes) cb)
```
This method is used to get the correspondent bank identifier of a correspondent bank module

| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | correspondent | [ISoCashBank](./api-t-ISoCashBank.md) | address | The correspondent bank module |


| Pos | Return | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | cb | [BankIdentifier](./api-t-BankIdentifier.md) | tuple | The correspondent bank identifier of the correspondent bank module |


#### ‚öôÔ∏è __credit__
Credit the account with new funds coming from money received in bank nostro or from a loan or equivalent

```js
function credit(address account, uint256 amount, string details) returns (bool)
```
Accounting wise, the account is only a liability side, so when recording a credit, the bank should record a debit in an asset account. Such asset account can be a nostro account, held on-chain or outside the blockchain, or can be against the recognition of money that the client owes to the banks (payable, loan, ...). 

Only whitelisted back office wallets can call this method.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è __debit__
Debit the account reducing the liability to the client against an asset of the bank

```js
function debit(address account, uint256 amount, string details) returns (bool)
```
Accounting wise, the account is only a liability side, so when recording a debit, the bank should record a credit in an asset account. Such asset account can be a nostro account, held on-chain or outside the blockchain, or can be against the recognition of money that the client owes to the banks (payable, loan, ...). 

Only whitelisted back office wallets can call this method.

| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | account | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account to debit |

```
Only whitelisted back office wallets can call this method. 

The bank module should have been given ownership of the account smart contract before the call (`transferOwnership()`).

Unlocks some funds of the client

```js
function unlockFunds(address account, uint256 amount) returns (bool)
```
The unlocked funds are usable by the client for spending and are part of the full balance of the account 

Note that this function is not to be confused with the `unlockFunds(amount)` method of the [ISoCashBankExternalWOTransfer](./api-ISoCashBankExternalWOTransfer) interface.

```js
function unregisterAccount(address account) returns (bool)
```
Only whitelisted back office wallets can call this method. 

The bank module should transfer the ownership to the caller wallet during the execution so that the back office can return the ownership to the client.

| Pos | Parameter | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | account | [ISoCashAccount](./api-t-ISoCashAccount.md) | address | The account to unregister |
