## üìú ISoCashOwnedAccount

Exposes the functions and events for basic interactions with a bank account in so|cash.

This interface inherits from [ISoCashAccountActions](./api-ISoCashAccountActions) and [ISoCashAccountData](./api-ISoCashAccountData) to provide the basic functions. 

It also inherits from [IERC20](./api-IERC20) and [IERC20Metadata](./api-IERC20Metadata) to provide the ERC20 compatibility. 

It also inherits from [ISoCashAccount](./api-ISoCashAccount) but this does not add any new function. 

It is used by the [ISoCashAccountFull](./api-ISoCashAccountFull) to provide the full set of functions.

Note that because this function is a transaction, the best way to retrieve the returned id of the HTLC it via the event `HTLCPaymentCreated` defined in [IHTLCPaymentInternal](./api-IHTLCPaymentInternal). 

To do this, retrieve the transaction hash of that transaction, gets the receipt and then the logs that match the block, the target smart contract and the event signature. 

Because the `hashlockPaid` is unique and indexed in the event you can also filter new events with that hash.

Only whitelisted senders can call this function or callers that has received an allowance. 

Allowance can be provided by a whitelisted sender using the `approve()` function of [IERC20](./api-IERC20).

function transferLockedFunds(bytes32 key, tuple(address account, bytes11 bic, bytes32 iban) recipient, string secret, string details) returns (bool)
```
This function is used to transfer locked funds to the pre-set recipient. 

Anyone can call this function as long as they have the valid secret. 

The `recipient` is ignored and will be removed in a future version. 

The `secret` is the secret that can unlock the payment. 

If successful, the HTLC `state` is set to `PAID` and the event `HTLCPaymentRemoved` is emitted revealing the secret.

This function is used to unlock locked funds. 

Only whitelisted sender can call this function. 

If successful, the HTLC `state` is set to `CANCELLED` and the event `HTLCPaymentRemoved` is emitted revealing the cancel secret if present. 

Note that to properly uses the cancel secret (that must be provided by the caller of the `lockFunds()` function), the `hashlockCancel`  must have been provided by the counterparty (and not the owner of the funds).  In that way, if the counterparty decide to no complete the process it can send the cancel secret to the initial holder in order to unlock the funds before the end of the deadline.  However, if the counterparty realizes that the lock does not contains its cancel hash (or a zero hash),  then it can decide not to proceed with the transaction as it can mean that the initial fund owner may have the actual secret to retrieve the funds  before the end of the deadline and the counterparty will not be able to retrieve the funds after completing its end of the bargain.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | key | bytes32 | bytes32 | The unique identifier of the payment. |

#### ‚öôÔ∏è __unlockedBalance__
Get the unlocked balance of the account.

```js
function unlockedBalance() view returns (uint256)
```
The unlocked balance is the amount of the account balance that is imediatly available for payment. 

 If the `balance` is lower than the `lockedBalance`, the `unlockedBalance` is zero, else it is the difference of the 2.

| Pos | Return | Type | Solidity | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | ‚åÄ | uint256 | uint256 | The unlocked balance of the account. |
