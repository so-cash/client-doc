## üìú ISoCashCountryReferentialFull

The country referential service is used to find and manage the referential of a country in the so|cash scope.

This interface inherits from [ISoCashCountryReferential](./api-ISoCashCountryReferential) and [I_IBANService](./api-I_IBANService). 

It is used to access the country referential and to create and decode IBANs.
