## ðŸ“œ ISoCashBankTransferManagementInternal interface 

Interface for exposing events related to the management of transfers that require manual intervention

### Events

#### ðŸ“¢ __TransfertStateChanged__
Event emitted when the status of a transfer is `PENDING`, `CANCELLED` or `PROCESSED`

```js
event TransfertStateChanged(uint256 indexed id, uint8 status)
```
This event is emitted when the bank module decides to put a transfer in pending, and then when the back office decides to cancel or process it
