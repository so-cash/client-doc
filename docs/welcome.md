## Welcome to so|cash documentation for Account owners

Sustainable & Open Cash Framework is a standard that aim at enabling account owners, banks and even central banks to manage cash bank account in an EVM blockchain.

Each bank will deploy a set of smart contracts that will act as a back office system to manage the deposit accounts. These smart contracts can call each other (when allowed) to create a correspondent banking network where operations happen in one blockchain transaction (atomicity).

From a account owner perspective, (i.e. client of banks) an account is a smart contract that acts as a proxy to the back office to store properties like the access rights, attributes (IBAN, interests rates, ...) and allows operations like transer to other accounts, allow third party to make transfer on behalf of the account owner, etc.

This site is designed to help developpers to interact with the smart contracts of the so|cash framework as account owner.
