Note that to properly uses the cancel secret (that must be provided by the caller of the `lockFunds()` function), the `hashlockCancel`  must have been provided by the counterparty (and not the owner of the funds).  In that way, if the counterparty decide to no complete the process it can send the cancel secret to the initial holder in order to unlock the funds before the end of the deadline.  However, if the counterparty realizes that the lock does not contains its cancel hash (or a zero hash),  then it can decide not to proceed with the transaction as it can mean that the initial fund owner may have the actual secret to retrieve the funds  before the end of the deadline and the counterparty will not be able to retrieve the funds after completing its end of the bargain.
